The objective of this project is to analyze sales data to extract actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions. By examining sales performance across various dimensions such as products, regions, and time periods, I aim to identify key trends, top-performing areas, and potential opportunities for improvement.

Region: The geographical area where the sale occurred (North, South, East, West).
Product: The specific product sold (Product A, Product B, Product C, Product D).
Sales_Amount: The revenue generated from the sale.
Units_Sold: The number of units sold in the transaction.
